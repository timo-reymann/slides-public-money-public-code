# Public Money<br />Public Code

What it is all about and why it just makes sense.

# The world we are living in

- is getting more digital every day
- software is everywhere
- governments and public institutions use mostly proprietary software or manual processes
- effort is duplicated all over the world
- we pay all of those with our taxes

---

# Why is that an issue?

- its not always transparent what money is spent on (e.g. licenses)
- much of the used software used is neither secure nor reliable
- every institution has to solve the same problems over and over again
- security by obscurity is not a good idea

# Real world examples

# Conclusion

- public code works
- open source is more secure, not less
- cost and effort is reduced
- fosters collaboration and engagement with the people

---

# We are not alone

Public Money - Public Code is a initiative by the Free Software Foundation

> We want legislation requiring that publicly financed software developed for the public sector be made publicly
> available under a Free and Open Source Software licence. If it is public money, it should be public code as well.

Digitalization, also for public institutions is a chance, not a threat. Let us use it wisely and most importantly,
let us do it together and transparent.
