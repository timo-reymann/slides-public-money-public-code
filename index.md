# Public Money<br />Public Code

What it is all about and why it just makes sense.

![bg left width:100%](./images/logo_public_money_public_code.jpg)

# The world we are living in

- Is getting more digital every day
- Software is **everywhere**
- Governments and public institutions use mostly proprietary software or manual processes
- Effort is duplicated all over the world
- We pay all of those with our taxes

---

# What is Open Source?

- Software whose source code is publicly available
- Anyone can view, use, modify, and distribute the software
- Licensed to ensure freedom and collaboration
- Examples: Linux, Firefox, LibreOffice, Corona Warn App

---

# Why does it matter?

- Its not always transparent what money is spent on (e.g. licenses)
- Much of the used software used is neither secure nor reliable
- Every institution has to solve the same problems over and over again
- Security by obscurity is not a good idea
- **Geopolitical pressure through dependencies** on foreign vendors
- **Vendor lock-in** leads to unpredictable cost changes and loss of control

# We are not alone

Public Money - Public Code is a initiative by the Free Software Foundation

> We want legislation requiring that publicly financed software developed for the public sector be made publicly
> available under a Free and Open Source Software licence. If it is public money, it should be public code as well.

Digitalization, also for public institutions is a chance, not a threat. Let us use it wisely and most importantly,
let us do it together and transparent.
